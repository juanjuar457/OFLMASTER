//structure used on 21 to 46 is the same structure every reducer
//you should set a default state,
//state=initialState
//then have a series of if-else stmnts that handle the diff action types
//in each if block you return the new state, modified according to each action.
//QQQ returning the NEW state isn't the same as directly mutating it?!**line 42 and 23!
// Dispatching actions to the store is the sole way in which you modify state using Redux, so you should get familiar with the flow of:
//
// Creating an action
// Handling it in a reducer
// Triggering it using dispatch

//can have other vals on 22, most common is action.type
//stand alone reducer with only if stmnt and can cause multiple actions to fire.
//1 action can fire many reducer calls.
