TODO: 
remove material + tie to ajax call 
add to DB on add + ""


// addDropDownUnits() {
    //     let dropDownUnits = {
    //         grams: this.refs.grams.value,
    //         kilograms: this.refs. kilograms.value,
    //         milliliters: this.refs.milliliters.value,
    //         misc: this.refs.misc.value
    //     }
    // }

have to use run build!!!! forgot for a sec.... 
header and home button! 

addMaterial() saved in a var w/ value refs pointing to the 
inputs that the user puts in, **from strings

then dispatches them as props
also calls the clearform func to clear the form on every add,
still need the button though... 
Clear on incomplete add.. 
*** THE DISPATCH WAS BEING USED
>>materialform.js is the center of the app... not sure if 1 comp 
holding all this info is a good thing????

>see where other proj does the ajax, weird b/c its not a form, its adding 
an image to get the thing rolling in that pic-add app. 

6/19
whats the news?? w/ other students?? 
OFL is my cross, uploading on my personal dropbox to keep private
-now have to npm run build whenever a change is made! OMG the time
-Main concern is getting back to how it was, then expand it out..
timestamps, urgent button etc... 
MOdal and Drop Down

nest down in a col 
row in a col, 
//granular bootsrap for getting 1/2's and breaking to smaller numbers 
//don't go to deep or you need to redo your strat, out of control.. once is okay 

<div className="col-md-1">
                        <div className="row">
                            <div className="col-md-6"></div> //each is a half...
                            <div className="col-md-6"></div>
                        </div>


look at how thunk comes back!! use superagent for the ajax cal itself! 
look up examples in text on thunk. 
maybe comps don't care how its declared the action handles the async mvmnt 
-- 6am dog walk 11pm sleep NO FUCKING PHONE 


6/23 - OFL stuff
gliph icon remove button won't work, use as regular delete! 

make DEl work by selecting the material vs rendering on each new material added to the 
form.. 

remove a div when its selected from the remove button!? 

THe form is cleared out via the refs, clear out material itself from 
whatever its being rendered in with. 
to have the delete the items added to the form MUST be kept in state, so they 
can be pointed to from a method and spliced out

OR overwritten with a new state when the delete is pressed to make sure the page is rendered 
with the selected item to be deleted GONE from the page.. 


shouldn't need react Router for comps, page is only stuck on material form.. 

maybe only page to update the deliver info and perhaps for the guest / admin functions. 

put in the thunk & superagent.. 

set up redux as well, state needs to be taken into account.. 

TO DO'S 
I. get the units drop down to render with new material when added. need to tie in 
with the correct method. 
II. Delete button
III. add home button
IV. main page (for landing and page for admin funcitons. )
V. Tie this sukcer to a redux store.
